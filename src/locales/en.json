    "p3": "I reached out to my cousin, Neta, and she patiently walked me through the basics — starter, feedings, folding, fermentation, oven steam, and more.",
    "p4": "My first loaves? Total failure. Flat. Dense. Too sour.",
    "p5": "But I didn't give up. I learned. I tried again. I read, I asked questions, I made mistakes, I improved. And I kept going."
